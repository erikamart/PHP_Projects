Here are 4 projects specific to using PHP with HTML, CSS, and MySQL.  The topics include:

  - Simple data list creations
  - Using formulas to populate monetary data
  - Accessing a database to insert, delete, modify
  - Using forms with a database to verify data

### Current Technical Issue

triviaQuestions.php is not working as intended. It shouldn't be changing the trivia questions every time 'Submit' is clicked. However, all the question counting and tries loops are working correctly.
Click here to view [Comp4] code.

There is also a simplified file copy to use for testing that only has the raw form structure and database connection without any other processing code.  Click here [test] to view the file.

### Todos

 - Fix trivia question query to save to session variable and only continue with new question when prompted.
 - Add 20min time limit to quiz
 - Update project names
 - make cohesive overall pages
